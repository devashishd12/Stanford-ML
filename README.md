# Please do not look at this code if you have not completed the labs yet. Do not refer to this repo as "answers". Use the online discussion forum to clear your doubts. Completing the labs yourself will help you a lot more. However, if you've already completed the labs you can refer/suggest here for vectorized implementations of the algorithms.
###Labs completed till now:

__Lab 1__: Implement Linear Regression to predict profits for a food truck, estimate housing prices in Portland, Oregon.

__Lab 2__: Implement to Logistic Regression to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

__Lab 3__: Implement OVR Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits.

__Lab 4__: Implement Neural Networks Backpropogation Algorithm to recognize handwritten digits.

__Lab 5__: Implement regularized Linear Regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

__Lab 6__: Implement SVM to build a spam classifier.

__Lab 7__: a) Using K-Means for image compression. b) Using PCA for finding low dimensional representation of face-images.

__Lab 8__: a) Using anomaly detection (Gaussian Model) to detect failing servers on a network. b) Using collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
